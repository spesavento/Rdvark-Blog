# Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
<p>
A sample of n random variables ($X_{1},X_{2}.... X_{n}$) is taken from the population. If the population distribution is not normally distributed, then the sample size should be greater or equal to 30 (n>=30). Consider each r.v. to be independent and identically distributed. The sample average and sum are as follows.
<p>
$\bar{X}$ = $\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{X_{i}}{n}$
<p>
T = $\sum_{i=1}^n X_{i}$
<br><br>
The **Central Limit Theorem** states that the sampling distribution of the average (or sum) of a large number of samples will follow a normal distribution regardless of the original population distribution.
<br>
Say the population distribution has mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. Then, <p>
$\bar{X}$ ~ N($\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$) <p>
T ~ N($n\mu, \sqrt{n}{\sigma}$)
<p>
<br>
This concept is best visualized. Let's begin with a population that has a normal distribution.

The population mean is $\mu$ = 10, and standard deviation $\sigma$ = 1. According to the CLT, if we take sample sizes of 100, then the sampling distribution for averages should become $\bar{X}$ ~ N($\mu,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$) = N(10,0.1). The sampling distribution for the sum should become T ~ N($n\mu, \sqrt{n}{\sigma}$) ~ N(1000, 10) <p>
