# Rdvark-Blog

### The Rdvark is a blog I created to review statistical concepts and their implementation in R.

The first user options I would like to implement are as follows:

* Drops rows with missing values
* Replaces missing values with the mode (for categorical variables) or median (for continuous variables) on a column-by column basis
* Finds similar names and asks if you would like to merge them (i.e. "LA" and "Los Angeles")
* Finds outliers in numerical variables and gives you options 1, 2 or to ignore
* Finds NA's, Nan's and NULL's and deals with them seperately


This package would hopefully promote the usage of R (the best data language).
